# Big-O Poster

In this repo you'll find printer-friendly poster of Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science.

It took me few days to fit already exiting information to the single page and make it printer friendly. Finally, I was able to make it look good on paper and it looks like this:

### License

You can print as many copies as you want (of any size you want) for personal and business needs. You can modify the poster.

### Open Source?

Seems like this repo became popular, which I didn't expect. Please give me some time to polish the source and release it under MIT [Creative Commons?] license. Thank you!
