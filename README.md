# Big-O Poster

In this repo you'll find printer-friendly poster of Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science.

It took me some time to fit already exiting information to the single page and make it printer friendly. Finally, I was able to make it look on the paper and it looks like this:

### License

You can print as many copies as you want (of any size you want) for personal and business needs. You can't modify the poster itself, BUT!

**I'll release the poster itself and it's source under MIT license if this repo will reach 2000 stars on GitHub!**

Enjoy, and happy printing!
