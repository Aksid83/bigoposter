# Big-O Poster

In this repo you'll find printer-friendly poster of Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science.

It took me few days to fit already exiting information to the single page and make it printer friendly. Finally, I was able to make it look good on paper and it looks like this:

### License

You can print as many copies as you want (of any size you want) for personal and business needs. You can't modify the poster.

### Star to Open Source

I need some time to polish the poster source to release it. If this repo will become popular and reach 2000 stars, I'll release the poster and it's source under MIT license!

Enjoy, and happy printing!
